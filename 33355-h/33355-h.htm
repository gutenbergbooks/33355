<h2>THE BUS</h2>


<p>The Bus is definitely the best bargain on Oahu. For 25¢ you can go just about
anywhere including around the island. School age children ride for 10¢.</p>

<p>If you'd like to take the four hour trip around Oahu, board the #8 bus to Ala
Moana Center requesting a transfer to Kaneohe/Wahiawa (#52) or Wahiawa/Kaneohe
(#52). They both circle the island but in different directions. If you stay on the
same bus for the entire trip, you'll have to pay another 25¢ at Ala Moana for the #8
bus which takes you back to Waikiki. Should you get off during your trip and board
another bus, request a transfer to use at the Ala Moana Center.</p>

<h3><b>Remember</b>:</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Take exact change. Drivers cannot make change.<br />
Luggage and large parcels are not allowed on the bus.<br />
Waikiki buses are often full, but don't fret. They run every three minutes.<br />
Most of the buses you will take from Waikiki downtown (toward Honolulu
or Ala Moana Shopping Center) should be boarded on Kuhio Ave.<br />
If you need a transfer, ask for one when you board the bus, not when you exit.</p></blockquote>

<h3><b>Geographical Directions</b></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Makai&mdash;toward the ocean</p>

<p>Mauka&mdash;toward the mountains</p>

<p>Diamond Head&mdash;toward the end of the island crowned by Diamond Head</p>

<p>Ewa&mdash;the opposite direction from Diamond Head</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For information about routes, times, regulations or sightseeing destinations, call

<h2>WAIKIKI</h2>

<p>Waikiki is where the action is&mdash;wave action and people action. This long series
of beautiful beaches is protected by an offshore reef a half mile out. Conditions
are ideal for surfing, outrigger canoe paddling and catamaran sailing. The people
come in waves that overflow the streets and fill the high rises. The ebb and flow of
humanity is a fascination in itself.</p>

<p>Waikiki is a peninsula separated from Honolulu by the Ala Wai Canal and bounded
by the sea and Diamond Head. Long a favorite summering place for Hawaiian royalty,
it is today a monument to the jet age.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Royal Hawaiian Hotel</b>&mdash;A reminder of times past when the well-to-do came by ship
and stayed a long time. The "pink palace" with its stately old world air and lush
plantings is worth seeing and strolling through.</p>

<p><b>Rainbow Bazaar</b>&mdash;Hilton Hawaiian Village. An acre of international shopping outlets.</p>

<p><b>U.S. Army Museum</b>&mdash;Fort Derussy. A guided tour of military memorabilia of the
army in Hawaii and the Pacific. (Tues.-Sat. 10-2, free.)</p>

<p><b>Waikiki Historical Room</b>&mdash;Sheraton Waikiki Hotel, 2nd floor. Early pictures of
Waikiki and famous people of the times. (Daily 9-5, free.)</p>

<p><b>Hemmeter Center</b>&mdash;Hyatt Regency Hotel. A fine selection of beautiful shops,
boutiques, art galleries and restaurants. (Daily, 9 a.m.-11 p.m.)</p>

<p><b>Waikiki Shopping Plaza</b>&mdash;Kalakaua Ave. Nine floors of vertical shopping and dining.</p>

<p><b>International Market Place</b>&mdash;A complex of open air shops and restaurants overseen
by huge banyan trees. Here you may watch craftsmen pounding tapa cloth,
making shell leis and painting portraits.</p>

<p><b>King's Alley</b>&mdash;Kaiulani Ave. Gallery exhibits, live shows and a complex of shops. The
daily 6:15 Changing of the Guard ceremony is followed by a free show of Hawaiian
entertainment. If you purchase a "Passport to Polynesia" you'll have fully paid
admission to King's Alley's Heritage Theatre, the Falls of Clyde maritime museum,
the Bishop Museum and planetarium that includes transportation between each
of these attractions.</p>

<p><b>Kapiolani Park</b>&mdash;A 220 acre park just below Diamond Head. Join the island residents
who jog, picnic and sleep under the shower trees. You might want to view Queen
Kapiolani's Rose Garden and take in a band concert if you're there on a Sunday
afternoon.</p>

<p><b>Honolulu Zoo</b>&mdash;Kapiolani Park. Very popular with locals and visitors alike, the zoo is
noted for its large Asian bird collection. On weekends artists display their work
around the zoo fence. (9-5, free)</p>

<p><b>Waikiki Aquarium</b>&mdash;Kapiolani Park. A privileged look at a wide variety of sea life
from Pacific waters including outdoor pools with turtles and seals children can
throw fish to.</p>

<p><b>Diamond Head</b>&mdash;Named for its volcanic crystals once thought to be diamonds, this
familiar landmark has seen a lot of changes take place at Waikiki. If you'd like
to hike its flank for a Diamond Head view of things, call the Hawaiian National
Guard for permission and directions.</p></blockquote>

<h2>OAHU'S EAST END</h2>

<h3>(Koko Head, Sea Life Park, etc.)</h3>

<p>The drive around the east end of the island from Waikiki to Koko Head, Sea
Life Park, Waimanlo and back through Nuuanu Pali's tunnels is as interesting a
35 mile tour as you're likely to take anywhere. The scenery is dramatic&mdash;rocky
coastline, wide sand beaches, transparent water, and offshore islands with the rugged

<h2>SURFING</h2>

<p>Waikiki's ideal surfing conditions&mdash;steady, dependable waves usually from two
to five feet&mdash;attracted Hawaiian royalty years ago. The surf today draws enthusiasts
from around the world. As a result, while the waves are still excellent, especially for
the novice surfer, there's usually a crowd. For more maneuvering space and a change
in scene, surfers should head for one of Oahu's other great surfing beaches.</p>

<h2>BEACHES</h2>

<p>From time to time strong currents, high surf and turbulent water affect every
beach on Oahu. Dangerous waves and rip tides are common during the winter months
especially on the north and west shores and at Koko Head Beach Park and Makapuu
Beach Park. The safest beaches are those under supervision of a lifeguard.</p>

<h2>FISHING</h2>

<p>How's the fishing? Stroll down to the International Market Place in Waikiki and
take a look at the marlin on display. There's your answer, all 1800 pounds of it.</p>

<p>Fishing is a year-round pleasure and for saltwater enthusiasts there are no seasonal
restrictions, no limits and no licenses required. You can also try your hand at surf
casting, spin fishing, spear fishing and fresh water fishing.</p>

<p>Honolulu boats fish for a mixed catch which may include mahimahi (dolphin),
Allison yellow fin tuna, giant bonefish, marlin, wahoo or bonita. Kewalo Basin near
Waikiki, the sport-fishing center for Oahu, offers a fine selection of charter craft and
experienced skippers. There's usually lively action off Koko Head, in the open sea
off Kaneohe Bay or in Molokai Channel.</p>

<h2>WEATHER</h2>

<p>Oahu weather is beautifully balmy, as near to perfection as you're likely to get
on this globe. Temperatures are generally in the seventies in the winter; in the summer
they creep up into the eighties. The average range in Honolulu varies only seven
degrees between August, the hottest part of the year, and January, the coolest time.
The difference between day and night peaks is about 12 degrees. At Waikiki the ocean
fluctuates narrowly between 75 and 82. In other words, if it's summer you want,
you've come to the right place.</p>

<p>The island is air conditioned by northeasterly trade winds which blow almost
all the time and usher in an occasional shower. During spring and summer these rains
are few and come mostly at night. In winter the trades are sometimes replaced by
Kona winds coming up from the south with sticky or stormy weather in tow. But
Kona winds are infrequent and rarely last more than a couple days.</p>

<p>Rainfall varies greatly according to local conditions. It's wetter to the windward
of the mountains and fairly dry on the leeward coast. The average rainfall in Waikiki
is about 20 to 25 inches per year, slightly more in Honolulu.</p>

<h2>OAHU'S PAST</h2>

<p>The volcanic cataclysms that pushed Oahu through the surface of the Pacific
four to six million years ago originated in a fault in the earth's crust at the bottom
of the ocean. Complete with rumbling, sputtering and spectacular fireworks, it was
a dramatic premiere performance. Today this gentle island, green and golden, belies
its violent birth. A millennium of rain, sunshine, waves and trade winds have sculpted
Oahu into a tropical jewel of lush valleys, mountains and curved sandy beaches.</p>

<p>The Polynesians were the first to successfully sail the vast reaches of the uncharted
Pacific to land in Hawaii. They dragged their huge double-hulled canoes ashore more
than 1000 years ago. The original inhabitants of Oahu from the Marquesas Islands
were followed by several waves of Tahitian immigrants.</p>

<p>Their primitive way of life came to an end with the arrival of Captain Cook in
1778. By the middle of the 19th century Honolulu Harbor had become a key Pacific
port for whalers, sandalwood and fur traders. In 1850 the Hawaiian Royal Court
moved permanently to Honolulu which has been the seat of government for monarchy,
republic, territory and state.</p>

<p>Immigrants came to Hawaii's tropical shores in continuing waves. New England
missionaries made their first hazardous trip around Cape Horn in 1820 bringing new
concepts of religion, agriculture, commerce and democratic government. As the native
population dwindled due to western diseases, laborers were needed to work the fields
for the rapidly growing sugar industry. Chinese, Japanese and Filipino immigrants
followed by Koreans, Portuguese and Puerto Ricans added new languages and cultures
to the island population.</p>

<p>In 1893 a provisional government was set up to replace the monarchy and one
year later the Republic of Hawaii was founded. The islands were annexed by the
U.S. in 1898 and made a territory in 1900. In 1959 Hawaii first flew the stars and
stripes as a full-fledged state.</p>

<p>Today Oahu welcomes an astounding number of visitors to share its exotic scenery,
eternal summer climate and warm aloha spirit.</p>

<h2>SUGAR AND PINEAPPLE</h2>

<p>People the world over have enjoyed the sweet and succulent products the Hawaiian
Islands are famous for&mdash;sugar and pineapple. These are the two most important
agricultural industries in the archipelago. Pineapple can grow at higher elevations
and needs less water than sugar cane so the crops don't compete for the same lands.
Because Hawaii must import most essentials from the U.S. mainland, the export of
sugar and pineapple is an important factor in the state's balance of trade. Also, with
the world running low on verdant spaces, sugar and pineapple are keeping Oahu green.</p>

<h3>SUGAR</h3>

<p>Sugar cane came to the islands in the hulls of the great canoes those early Polynesians
sailed across the Pacific. Hawaiians planted it as a windbreak around their homes
and broke off sections to chew when they traveled.</p>

<p>The first sugar plantation in Hawaii was started in Manoa Valley on Oahu in
1825 and the first export recorded was two tons in 1837. The Royal Hawaiian
Agricultural Society was instrumental in bringing the initial shipment of Chinese
laborers to work the fields in 1852. This was the beginning of waves of immigrant
workers who have contributed a wealth of cultural diversity to Hawaii.</p>

<p>Cane on Oahu takes about two years to mature. The industry is highly mechanized
and has virtually eliminated hand labor. Just before harvest, whole fields of cane
are deliberately set on fire. This destroys unwanted leaves and other trash and does
not affect the sugar content.</p>

<p>Hawaii's sugar industry is recognized as the world's leader in sugar technology
and production and its workers are among the highest paid full-time agricultural
workers in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<h2>PINEAPPLE</h2>

<p>Pineapple was first introduced to the islands by a counselor to King Kamehameha
the Great in 1813. Today's industry got its greatest impetus from Captain John
Kidwell, an English horticulturist who searched the world for a pineapple variety
that would be most suitable to Hawaii. The Jamaican variety known as the Smooth
Cayenne which he introduced is still the predominant strain grown in Hawaii.</p>

<p>In 1899 a young New Englander, James B. Dole, built a cannery next to pineapple
growing on his own lands in Wahiawa on Oahu. The first year's output in 1903 was
1800 cases. Today the Dole company packs this amount in just a few minutes.</p>

<p>Pineapple takes nearly two years of careful tending before it matures. Then
each low-growing plant yields only one fruit. A year later the same plant will produce
one or two more pineapples; then the whole process must be repeated.</p>

<p>At harvest time, pickers move through the fields placing the fruits on long-armed
conveyors, a process which at the peak of the season continues on into the night with
the help of lighted booms.</p>

<p>Only those who have tasted a field-ripened Hawaiian pineapple know what real
pineapple is all about. The airport is full of enlightened visitors who are taking cartons
of these succulent fruits home with them.</p>
